* Write tests for every array method
* Lil refactoring; this is some of the messiest code i have my name to open-source-wise
* rename 'array' to 'list'?  It's a pita to write 'array' all the time -.-
* have persist return the persistent version of an object? - i.e. persist([1, 2, 3]) or persist({x: 3}) returns a persistent list/array and dict respectively?
* structural sharing? - to what degree?
* perf tests - memory, GC spikes, etc
* make an iterator like es6 spec
